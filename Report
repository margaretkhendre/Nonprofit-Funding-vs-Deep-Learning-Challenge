## Overview of the Analysis
In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge.

Explain the purpose of the analysis.
The purpose of this analysis is to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk in order to identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

Explain what financial information the data was on, and what you needed to predict.
The financial data described loan details like loan size, interest rate, borrower income, loan status, etc. In order to create a prediction, the data was split into training and testing datasets, a logistic regression model was created, the model was fit using training data, and then .predict() was used on the test data.

Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., value_counts).
The y values, or loan status of individuals in the dataset are what we want to predict. In this case, 0 indicates a healthy loan while 1 indicates a high risk loan. Value_counts tells us that there are 75036 healthy loans and 2500 high risk loans in this dataset.

Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
To start, the data was split into training and testing sets, next, X and y variables were created and the data was split using train_test_split, then a logistic regression model was created with the original data and fit using the training data. Predictions were made next and then the models performance was tested by calculating the accuracy score, generating a confusion matrix, and printing a classification report. After this, a logistic regression model was predicted with resampled training data using the RandomOverSampler module and repeating the previous process, only this time using that resampled data.

Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., LogisticRegression, or any resampling method).
The logistic regression module was used to aid predictions throughout the analysis, and the RandomOverSampler was used to create resampled data. This allowed the original training data to be fit to the newly created model where further predictions and performance could be evaluated.

Results
Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

Machine Learning Model 1:

Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.
Accuracy score: 99%- good!
Healthy loans see ideal precision and f1 scores at 100%, while recall is at 99%
High-risk loans' precision is 15% lower than healthy loans
High-risk loans are also at lower recall and f1-score values than the healthy loans with 8% and 2% variations (respectively)
Machine Learning Model 2:

Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.
Accuracy score: 99%- good!
Precison, recall, and f1 have remained the same for healthy loans
High-risk loans experienced general increase in recall and f1-score- 8% and 3% (respectively)
High-risk loans experienced a decrease in precision by 1%
Summary
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:

Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
It seems that Machine Learning Model 2 performs the best because we see a general increase in recall and f1 scores, and even the macro average. Accuracy is at 99% for both models, but if one must choose, then the inceases do indicate Model 2 as the better performing model.

Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the 1's, or predict the 0's? )
It is important to predict both the ones and zeros in order to determine a the creditworthiness of borrowers. Being able to compare the two allows for well-rounded predictions and conclusions to be made.
