## Overview of Analysis 
Explain the purpose of this analysis.

- The purpose of this analysis is to create a tool for the nonprofit foundation, Alphabet Soup, that can help it select applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. 

**Results**: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions:

Data Preprocessing

What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
- The target for this model is X, or all of the columns in the new_application_df, excluding the "IS_SUCCESSFUL" column.

What variable(s) are the features for your model?
- The feature for this model is the y, or the "IS_SUCCESSFUL" colunn in the new_application_df.

What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
